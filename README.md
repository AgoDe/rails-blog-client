# Rails Blog Client
This is a project for a blog built with microservice structure, using Vue3 for client side and Ruby on Rails 7 for the back-end

For this client project I used this package:
- Vue 3 + Vite
- Vue router 
- Pinia | Vue state management
- Axios | for API (but I used more fetch)
- Tailwind CSS
- flowbite | for rapid UI construction
